# len is a built-in function, not a string method
# isalpha() -> only letters
# strip() -> get rid of leading and trailing spaces
# split() -> without an arguement, the string will be splitted by white space
# whenever using 'is,' boolean value will always be returned

# name = 'Kotaro Yabe'


# count = 0
# for letter in name:
#     if letter in 'aeiou':
#         count += 1

# print(count)
