# Tue/Thu 6:30-7:00 office hours
# always add docstrings, followed by comments
# function variables and parameters are local

# def f(x):
#     y = x + 1
#     return y

# z = f(5)
# print(z)

# If a function does not return any value, it is NONE
# return is an assignment to a value
# print() is for debugging purpose
# y is a local variable and hence does not exist

# Return immediately terminates the fucntion
# Put some valid value in and a function which does not take any value will run
# Add comments for what to do / pass / return

# def f():
#     print('Hi')

# print(f())

# first, f() was called within the print function
# there is no value assigned to f(), so nothing will be printed
# It is a function, not a variable

# if f(a), is if f(a) is not None

# Add more comments!!!

# Docstrngs, Docstrings, Docstrings!!!

# What if exercises are too difficult?
#
# 1. Do I understand the concepts?
# 2. Have I attempted example/demo code?
# 3. Have I read supplemental materials?
# 4. Have I tried any debugging approaches?
# 5. Have I had enough rest?
# 6. Have I asked for help?

# Pseudo-code = using normal English to decribe codes

# DOCSTRINGS!!!

# Keep a function single-purposed!!!

# if x = TRUE: >>> if x:

# print(2 ** 38)

# If I wanna learn python, I have to code a lot!!!
