# Quiz Instruction
This quiz is a simplified version of FIFA Ultimate Team game. In this game:
1. Each team will be initialized with given name and initial players (if any). 
2. Each team will choose multiple players from `PLAYERS` which is a dictionary of player's name and his rating.
3. Team's rating is the average rating of all the players in this team. When there is no player in the team, this team's rating should be 0. 
4. Each team has one opportunity to choose one player from `LEGENDARIES` which is a dictionary of legendary players (key is the legendary player's name, and value is a tuple of his rating and his chemistry booster value). After choosing a legendary player, the team's rating will be the average rating of all the players in this team (including this legendary player) multiplied by chemistry booster value.
5. If two teams play against each other, the team with higher rating will always win.


To simulate FIFA Ultimate Team game, we need to create a class named `Team` with the following **attributes**: 
1. `name`: a string representing the team's name
2. `squad`: a list of all players' names (strings)
3. `rating`: a float which is the team's rating (see above GAME RULE 3 and 4 on how a team's rating is calculated.)

Please finish the following **methods** for the class `Team`:
1. An `__init__` method that initializes `name`, `squad`, and `rating` according to GAME RULE 3. Remember, `initial_players` could be `None` or a list of names.
2. A `__str__` method that returns a string representation of this team, including `name` and all players' names (if any). Please read the expected output below to understand what this method should return.
3. A method named `choose` that takes a player's name from `PLAYERS`, adds it to `squad` and updates `rating` according to GAME RULE 3.
4. A method named `choose_legendary` that takes a legendary player's name from `LEGENDARIES`, adds it to `squad` and updates `rating` according to GAME RULE 4. **OPTIONAL**: you can combine `choose` and `choose_legendary` functions into `choose` function by using proper keyword arguments.
5. A special method that overloads the operator "`>`" to return the result of a game according to GAME RULE 5. Please read the expected output below to understand what this method should return.

### Please DO NOT change code in `main` function!
